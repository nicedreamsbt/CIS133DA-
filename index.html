		<h1> Michael Dulin</h1>
		<p> Hello World ! I am taking <b>CIS133DA</b> because it is a requirement for my <i>associates in programming and system anaylisis</i>. I really love programming but wish I had more time to do it. Currently I am working on learning adroid development on my own through <b><i><u>Udacity</u></i></b>. I have already taken <u>Java level 2</u> and I have a decent understanding on programming concents and just need more pratice and to have a portfolio of projects. Currently I am working on a android app that will collect information about a current job, use the google maps and places api to get a map of the job location, allow drawing of sewer & the bore path for the project and allow text entrys for depths of the sewer. I think it will make a much cleaner report for the customer instead of drawing the maps by hand. I hope to be able to learn a lot about web designe in CIS133DA and be able to apply this information to other projects where apps or programs interface with a webpage allowing data and information to be shared through the app & website.
